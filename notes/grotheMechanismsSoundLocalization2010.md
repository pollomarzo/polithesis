> The ability to determine the location of a sound source is fundamental to hearing. However, auditory space is not represented in any systematic manner on the basilar membrane of the cochlea, the sensory surface of the receptor organ for hearing. Understanding the means by which sensitivity to spatial cues is computed in central neurons can therefore contribute to our understanding of the basic nature of complex neural representations. We review recent evidence concerning the nature of the neural representation of auditory space in the mammalian brain and elaborate on recent advances in the understanding of mammalian subcortical processing of auditory spatial cues that challenge the “textbook” version of sound localization, in particular brain mechanisms contributing to binaural hearing.

##### neuronal mechanisms of ild processing
- & Although temporally precise inputs have been demonstrated not to be required for ILD sensitivity of the sustained response of neurons in the LSO, timing does in fact appear to be important for generating ILD sensitivity at stimulus onset and, generally, to LSO neurons tuned to low-frequency sounds (77, 101, 176). In particular, increasing evidence exists to suggest that, based on their known excitatory-inhibitory (EI) interaction, low-frequency LSO neurons are sensitive to ITDs, with a resolution almost comparable to that of neurons in the MSO [(p. 991)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=991&annotation=YZAEB48K)
- & In contrast to MSO neurons, however, coincidence of ipsilateral excitatory input with the contralateral, inhibitory input generates response minima (“troughs” in the rate versus ITD functions); peak activity occurs when inputs are noncoincident (or maximally out of phase in response functions) [(p. 991)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=991&annotation=T8LJY5CX)
- & Whereas ILD sensitivity in LSO neurons is characterized by sigmoidal ILD functions that shift in a systematic manner with increasing intensity to the excitatory ear, those in IC are less affected. [(p. 992)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=992&annotation=YJZVBIV3)
- & given the sufficiency of the LSO in producing neural sensitivity to ILDs, it seems likely that ILD sensitivity in the majority of IC neurons reflects LSO input, [(p. 992)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=992&annotation=8AGIV2AF)
##### neuronal mechanisms of itd processing
- & In mammals, it appears that neurons in both of the major nuclei of the lower auditory brain stem, the MSO and the LSO, are capable of extracting ITD information from their binaural inputs, although the MSO has traditionally been considered the major site of ITD processing [(p. 993)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=993&annotation=5HILYA89)
- & Input from the MNTB, which is driven by stimulation of the contralateral ear, as well as input from the ipsilaterally driven LNTB, have been shown to evoke inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in MSO cells in vitro [(p. 994)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=994&annotation=GWQLP8ET)
- & Primary auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) synapsing at the base of the inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea respond to the cycle-by-cycle changes in the IHC membrane potential (itself reflecting the back-and-forth deflections of the stereocilia) with action potentials that are “phase-locked” to the stimulus waveform (65, 113, 201). Phase-locking in ANFs degrades with increasing frequency with a pronounced roll-off above 2–3 kHz (106), although fibers along the full length of the basilar membrane show phase-locking if they are capable of responding to a low-frequency stimulus [(p. 994)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=994&annotation=WX2ELSGC)
- & Note that the limitation to phase locking does not arise in the ANFs per se (90). Rather, it reflects the reduction in capability of the receptor potential of the IHCs to follow the cycle-by-cycle deflection of the stereocilia at increasing stimulation frequencies. [(p. 994)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=994&annotation=RR7ZCUFV)
- & despite decades of research, it remains unclear how the four inputs to MSO neurons interact to produce the well-described ITD sensitivity of MSO neurons, and how ITD sensitivity of single MSO neurons provides for a meaningful representation of auditory spatial cues. [(p. 994)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=994&annotation=BNYC46G6)
- £ this is due to the technically demanding nature of in vivo recordings from low-frequency MSO cells, most likely as a result of the high degree of myelination of input fibers (161), the strong neurophonic potential generated by their phase-locked synaptic input (162, 269), and the possibility that action potentials are generated some distance from the soma along the axon [(p. 994)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=994&annotation=9NWVBURU)
- £ Similarly, in vitro recordings from acute brain slices, the only means so far by which the cellular properties of MSO and its inputs can be investigated, grow rapidly more difficult with each day following hearing onset. As a result, almost all intracellular recordings have been performed in immature brain tissue, [(p. 994)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=994&annotation=D67ZZ9QP)
- & the two monaurally evoked responses is generally far below the response to binaural stimulation at favorable ITDs [(p. 996)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=996&annotation=JFV622ZQ)
- & binaural stimulation at favorable ITDs normally evokes far higher degrees of phase-locking than stimulation at unfavorable ITDs [(p. 996)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=996&annotation=3EBU9JSL)
- & Consistent with theoretical outcomes of Jeffress’ (1948) model (103), many MSO neurons show a characteristic delay (CD): an ITD for which the relative discharge rate is identical for different stimulus frequencies [(p. 996)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=996&annotation=EIIJ7CSY)
- & Nevertheless, the relative stability of the BITD as a function of frequency underlying the notion of a characteristic delay is predicated on the concept of purely excitatory coincidence detection and, combined with its predictability based on the monaural responses, has been taken as evidence for, if not definitive proof of, an underlying mechanism similar to that proposed by Jeffress’ 1948 model [(p. 996)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=996&annotation=PTY8GKI9)
- £ Despite its general acceptance, an increasing number of studies report findings that are inconsistent with the standard Jeffress model [(p. 996)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=996&annotation=52UGJSI7)
- & Hence, BITDs should lie largely within the physiological range of ITDs [(p. 996)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=996&annotation=GPK4C28T)
- £ for mammals. Indeed, BITDs appear not to be restricted to the physiological range (or at least predominantly within it, again as found in birds), but often lie beyond it, at ITDs greater than would be created by the interaural distance. [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=MXANHXNE)
- & Furthermore, there appears to be little difference in the distribution of BITDs between species with different interaural distances [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=W6YWK7S2)
- & BITDs far beyond the range of ITDs predicted by the animal’s head width, [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=RECCCPQG)
- & BITDs outside the rabbit’s physiological range. [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=JZVAFN5B)
###### the large number of cells with bitds beyond that predicted by the size of the head
- & the existence of BITDs outside the range predicted by the head size could be explained by the need to process reverberations that result in reduced correlations of the phase-locked inputs between the two ears [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=6NC8IRKZ)
- & the mixing of multiple direct and indirect sound sources that results in reduced interaural coherence (15) produces rapidly fluctuating ITDs and ILDs that can greatly exceed the “physiological range” [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=8LAV4DWM)
- & Nevertheless, such long ITDs are relatively rare in most natural environments and their importance lessened by relatively long integration times at higher auditory stations [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=EMDW6GSK)
- & no particular reason why the mammalian auditory system might devote the majority of its ITD-sensitive neurons to the processing of interaurally decorrelated sounds or fluctuating ITDs that do not [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=KNCUYJLH)
###### the requirement for exceptionally long delay lines originating from the contralateral ear
- & A detailed anatomical analysis comes from Oliver and colleagues (10) who performed a complex reconstruction of small tracer injections into the CN. Their results include an analysis of the axonal diameter of individual fibers and suggest some form of graded input from the contralateral side where, in some reconstructions, shorter collaterals tended to innervate more rostral parts of MSO and longer collaterals more caudal [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=Y6SZW64M)
- & However, other injections revealed very restricted terminal fields or even gradients running in the “wrong” directions. [(p. 997)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=997&annotation=5N3PH4KZ)
- **chick brain??? isn't that a bird?**:
	- & a factor that has received little attention until lately is the distance of nodes of Ranvier and the influence of axon diameter, which could, if varied from axon to axon or at different axonal branches, easily contribute to a substantial delay (42); accordingly, data from the chick brain stem indicate a significant contribution of internode distance [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=PEZ4VSSG)
- **TODO: was this one included with the comol (?) project?**:
	- & Another form of physical delay that has been proposed to contribute to ITD processing is the cochlear delay [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=5QCUX3YI)
- & it must be stated that no convincing evidence for the employment of such cochlear delays in the tuning of neurons to a preferred ITD has been provided [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=EBHFS9NL)
- & Yet another means by which internal delays could be generated, and by which the experimentally observed phase delays could be explained, is synaptic inhibition [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=3KPVJTSG)
- & blocking glycinergic inhibition with strychnine results in a broadening of the ITD tuning function towards ipsilaterally leading ITDs resulting in a shift of the best ITD towards 0 [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=LXF8LF9N)
- & Anatomical refinement of the glycinergic inhibition has been shown to be dependent, at least partially, on auditory experience during early development. [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=5F6SLKLZ)
- & In animals subject to such deprivation, the distribution of BITDs deviates significantly from that in control animals; BITDs are, on average, much closer to 0 ITD than in normally reared animals [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=JQJRFA8F)
- & Moreover, by changing the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs (compare Ref. 137), it is possible that BITDs might also be adjusted under dynamic control as needed (e.g., in noisy environments with many concurrent sounds) [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=LMXDSQRX)
- & Nevertheless, even though ILDs are of marginal importance for low-frequency sound localization [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=9A2Q7DST)
- & an entire limb of the LSO appears dedicated to the processing of low-frequency sounds in many species. [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=YV6NZ8A7)
- & This study also provided direct evidence to corroborate the notion that LSO neurons generate the trough-type ITD sensitivity expected from phase-locked EI interactions. [(p. 998)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=998&annotation=RIUEG2TP)
#### neuronal representation of auditory space
- **i'll leave this as reference**:
	##### The auditory space map in birds [(p. 999)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=999&annotation=9IDTLVUF)
##### the representation of binaural cues in mammals
- & several significant differences exist between the representations of acoustic-spatial features in barn owls and mammals. [(p. 1002)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1002&annotation=MY3YPU33)
- & the convergence of ITD and ILD cues in the barn owl’s OT, from neurons with similar frequencytuning characteristics in the IC, is absent in mammals; by and large, sensitivity to fine-structure ITDs is absent for any frequency at which an appreciable ILD would be generated (except for near-field situations). [(p. 1002)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1002&annotation=SKCTYKW6)
- & animals deprived of visual input show abnormal arrangements of ILDs in the SC (115), although they do not show deficits in sound localization and, indeed, may actually show improved performance [(p. 1002)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1002&annotation=4TT3H3BD)
###### the neural representation of ild.
- & A systematic representation of ILD has often been assumed (193) to exist in the mammalian LSO, but has never actually been demonstrated. [(p. 1002)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1002&annotation=PXBZUQLP)
- & LSO neurons do not code for absolute positions in space in the manner of a “labeledline” code but, rather, the overall relative activation of the left and the right ILD pathways, which appears stable across the population of ILD sensitive neurons (177), likely encodes the source location [(p. 1002)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1002&annotation=Q3QME6P6)
###### the neuronal representation of itd.
- & Moreover, the projection pattern of the MSO to the IC would imply that this suggested organization in the MSO is not maintained in the IC [(p. 1002)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1002&annotation=B9WEAE5W)
- £ Based on these findings, the current authors earlier postulated a reconsideration of the mammalian system emphasizing the encoding of spatial positions by changes in spike rate across the span of “physiological” ITDs in the entire population of homogeneously (in terms of BIPD) and broadly-tuned (due to their low CFs) ITD-sensitive neurons (145): neurons with the lowest CFs have, necessarily, the broadest ITD functions in response to interaurally delayed signals; even for relatively large changes in ITD, encompassing perhaps the entire range experienced by a small mammal such as a gerbil, the response near the peak of the function may change only very slightly. As such, positioning the peak of the ITD function at long ITDs, beyond the ecologically relevant range, places the sensitive slope of the function where greatest ITD discrimination is required. By shifting the peak ITD closer to zero for neurons as CF increases, the position of the slope through the range of relevant ITDs is maintained (Fig. 12, D–F). Accordingly, the steepest portions of the slopes were found to align around midline both in MSO, DNLL, and IC (86, 146, 181, 215, 219). It has also been shown that such alignment allows for high-resolution ITD discrimination both on the single cell and population level (214, 220). [(p. 1002)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1002&annotation=ED59NNTL)
- & stands in contrast to the labeled-line arrangement, in which spatial positions are encoded in the specific activity patterns of only a few identified neurons within an array of heterogeneously (in terms of BIPD) and sharply-tuned (due to their high CFs) neurons. It should be stressed that the two paradigms do not necessarily differ in the coding strategy at the single-neuron level, as spatial discrimination is maximal along the slope of the neurons’ tuning curve regardless of coding strategy [(p. 1003)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1003&annotation=5SI8PQ3E)
##### dynamics in neuronal representation
- & One class of efferent connections seems to mainly originate in the auditory cortex and targets auditory neurons at different levels of the system: the medial geniculate body, the IC, several rhombomeric structures (SOC, CN), and even the hair cells in the cochlea. These projections are known to influence tuning properties dependent on short-term experience and, hence, seem to be related to stimulus context [(p. 1003)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1003&annotation=UY55M9TZ)
- & Another class of efferent connections arises in the SOC and targets directly inner and outer hair cells (218). These provide a fast form of sensory feedback that, for instance, adjusts the gain of the auditory system to take account of overall sound intensity [(p. 1003)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1003&annotation=2RB5TXD5)
- & Until recently, the efferent system was not considered with respect to binaural processing, and stimulus-dependent adaptation and context dependency were typically not attributed to the first stations of the binaural pathways. [(p. 1003)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1003&annotation=MKSHTVA2)
- & For a number of reasons, however, this view is changing. First, evidence exists that the fast feedback providing olivocochlear system can influence binaural sensitivity via the lateral olivocochlear feedback system (45). Second, evidence exists for dynamic adjustments within the binaural nuclei themselves. [(p. 1003)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1003&annotation=ME977PIR)
- & at the very least, LSO neurons are able to adjust rapidly the efficacy of their excitatory and inhibitory inputs, altering their binaural sensitivity in the process [(p. 1004)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1004&annotation=72VIAF93)
#### appendix c: role of glycinergic inhibition in itd processing in the mso
- & Indirect evidence for an important role of the inhibitory inputs to the MSO for tuning ITD sensitivity comes, on one hand, from in vitro experiments in which contralaterally driven inhibitory inputs were found to dominate binaurally coincident excitation (80). This occurs only over a very short time window (a few hundreds of microseconds) when examined in acute brain slices excised some 10 days following hearing onset (81). In fact, these inhibitory effects are extremely strong, generated by some of the fastest- and shortest-acting inhibitory currents measured to date. When measured during blockade of other currents, which normally increases input resistance, potentially slowing membrane kinetics, time constants of isolated glycine currents (measured in even younger tissue; 4 –5 days following hearing onset) remain in the range of 1–2 ms (136, 221). [(p. 1005)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1005&annotation=2ZRHEED5)
- & More interesting, however, the inhibitory block asserts an asymmetric effect on ITD functions of the neurons tested: notably, the slope of the ITD function closest to zero (the slope “facing” ipsilateral ITDs) shifts to beyond the physiological range due to increased responsiveness to ipsilateral leading ITDs. As a result, the BITD shifts toward 0 ITD (indicating less effective contralateral-leading stimulation; Fig. 14). In contrast, the contralateral-facing slope is almost unaffected by blockade of inhibition. These effects are reversible, with the BITD returning to its original value a few minutes following termination of the iontophoretic application of strychnine [(p. 1005)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1005&annotation=ZLPL8J7W)
- £ The effect of blocking glycinergic inhibition with strychnine shifts both the onset as well as the ongoing component of each neuron’s ITD function. [(p. 1005)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1005&annotation=24MWSWY3)
- **TODO: ask desa if tonic means "always" as opposed to phase-locked... otherwise i don't understand what this part means**:
	- £ tonic [(p. 1005)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1005&annotation=2FT2MRAQ)
- £ this scenario relies on the existence of phase-locked, and therefore well-timed, inhibitory inputs derived mainly from the contralateral side. Such inputs could, with each cycle of the stimulus fine-structure, postpone the net excitation arriving from the contralateral side if contralaterally evoked inhibition precedes contralaterally evoked excitation by a few hundred microseconds [(p. 1006)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1006&annotation=6S4ZWRT6)

- £ Is inhibition fast enough? As outlined in the main body of the text, repolarization time constants for the inhibition in the gerbil MSO assessed in vitro are in the range of 1–2 ms (136) and effective in suppressing subsequent firing for 1 ms (81), which would be sufficiently fast for the proposed mechanism of ITD processing for frequencies up to at least 1 kHz. The question remains then, What happens for higher frequencies? Interestingly, recent calculations based on optimal coding theory suggested a dichotomy for ITD coding strategies dependent on frequency with the cutoff frequency being 1 kHz for the gerbil [(p. 1007)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5439920/items/MURHBCCD?page=1007&annotation=7J56DI6V)%% end annotations %%
